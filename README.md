The rules for this calculator are slightly confusing. It is helpful to start at www.rusa.org/octime_alg.html in order to look at the chart for the different projected speeds depending on how far into the race the riders would be. For any checkpoint in between the times the opening and closing times are based off the speed the riders could be going at that specific time plus whatever different speed they went at in the future getting to that specific time. Examples of how this works can also be found on the website above.
